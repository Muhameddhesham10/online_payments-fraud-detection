# Online Payments Fraud Detection
What is fraud detection?
According to the definition provided by the Cambridge Dictionary, fraud is the “crime of getting money by deceiving people.” Fraud has existed in one form or another for many centuries. Ever since people started to exchange goods and services, there has been a risk of one party scamming another and third parties scamming both sellers and buyers. 

# Objective about Online-Payments-Fraud-Detection
objective of this project is to develop and implement machine learning models for detecting fraudulent transactions in online payments. The project aims to analyze transaction data, identify patterns indicative of fraud, and build predictive models to help payment processors and financial institutions reduce fraud losses and protect customers

# About the Project
The Online Payments Fraud Detection project aims to develop a robust and efficient system for detecting fraudulent transactions in online payment systems. With the increasing use of online payment methods, detecting and preventing fraud has become a critical issue for businesses and consumers alike. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques to identify fraudulent transactions and minimize financial losses.

# Key Components
- Data Collection: Gathering transaction data from online payment systems, including transaction amount, time, location, and other relevant features.
**Dataset**  For this python project, I had used the dataset; the dataset is available in the public domain and you can find it [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rupakroy/online-payments-fraud-detection-dataset)
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure its quality and prepare it for analysis. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling 
  numerical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to gain insights into the underlying patterns and characteristics of fraudulent transactions.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features from the existing data that may help improve the performance of the fraud detection model.
- Model Selection and Training: Selecting appropriate machine learning models, such as logistic regression, random forest, or gradient boosting, and training them on the preprocessed data.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their effectiveness in detecting fraud.
- Deployment: Deploying the trained model into a production environment where it can be used to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time.
- Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitoring the performance of the deployed model and updating it as necessary to adapt to new fraud patterns
# Technologies Used
- Python for data preprocessing, analysis, and model training.
- Scikit-learn and TensorFlow/Keras for building and evaluating machine learning models.
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn For data visualization to understand the distribution and patterns.
- Plotly: For interactive visualizations.
